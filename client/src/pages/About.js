                <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!  I am a full stack developer with a focus in MySQL, API construction, and Javascript.  I graduated from the University of Minnesota's Continuing & Professional Studies college in May 2018 and am currently seeking employment within the Twin Cities Metro.
                <br />
                <br />
                Before attending the first full time coding "bootcamp" at the University of Minnesota, I attended St. Olaf College where I received a major in both English and Japanese, with an emphasis in Asian Studies, in May 2017.  My sister introduced me to the idea of Web Development the following fall and I began to self-study on Khan Academy and Code Academy.  I enjoyed these online courses immensely, so I decided to attend a bootcamp and began work within the technological industry as soon as possible.
